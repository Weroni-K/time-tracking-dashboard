# Time Tracking Dashboard ðŸ“…

Welcome :wave: to the Time tracking dashboard, Frontend Mentor challange.


### Project description ðŸ“œ

This project involves building a single-page website that showcases time tracking dashboard.The dashboard is interactive and presents a set of activities with hourly counts, which change dynamically based on the selected filter (daily, weekly, monthly). The challenge is to recreate the provided designs and to achieve desired functionality, ensuring optimal layout across different devices. I decided to develop the project using Vue.js and CSS.

Desired layout idea, as well as other assets, were provided by the Frontend Mentor.
